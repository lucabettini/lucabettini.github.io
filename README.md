# LUCABETTINI.GITHUB.IO

This website was created as a project for [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/).<br>
The requisites were:<br>
- A biography 
- An image of myself 
- Images of my projects
- Links to my projects
- A contact form or another way to get in touch with me 
<br>
**Note: for additional documentation on layout choices look at .styles/main.scss**<br>
I opted for a simple static website with four pages, including a homepage, a profile page, a gallery of my projects and a contact page.<br>
I used a [Bootstrap carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/) in the Projects page, linked to a gallery made with the [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) library.<br>
I made the form using a customized [Bootstrap form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/), connected to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/).<br>
Finally, I translated all the page in my mother language (italian) and added a link on the left corner to page to assist the user in choosing his preferred language.<br>
